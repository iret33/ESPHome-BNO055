ESPHome BNO055 Component

A custom ESPHome component for the BNO055 9-axis absolute orientation sensor, designed to provide precise orientation data including pitch, roll, and yaw. This component leverages I¬≤C communication and is built for seamless integration into ESPHome projects.
Features

  Provides orientation data: pitch, roll, and yaw.
   Designed for ESP32 and ESP8266 platforms.
    Easy integration with ESPHome configurations.
    Powered by the Adafruit BNO055 Library.

Installation
Prerequisites

   An ESP32 or ESP8266 device.
    A BNO055 sensor connected via I¬≤C.
    ESPHome installed on your system (Get Started).

Steps

   Clone this repository into your ESPHome project directory:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/esphome-bno055.git

Add the component to your ESPHome configuration:

   Include the custom component:

    esphome:
    name: bno055_test
    includes:
    - components/bno055/bno055.h

  Register the component:

    custom_component:
      - lambda: |-
          auto bno = new esphome::bno055::BNO055Sensor();
          App.register_component(bno);

Add your I¬≤C configuration to the YAML file (if not already present):

    i2c:
      sda: GPIO21
      scl: GPIO22
      scan: true

Compile and upload the firmware:

    esphome run example.yaml

Dependencies

This component depends on the following libraries:

    Adafruit Unified Sensor Library
    Adafruit BNO055 Library

Make sure these libraries are installed and available in your PlatformIO environment.
Example Configuration

Here‚Äôs a complete example YAML file for integrating the BNO055 component:

esphome:
  name: bno055_test
  includes:
    - components/bno055/bno055.h

esp32:
  board: esp32dev

i2c:
  sda: GPIO21
  scl: GPIO22
  scan: true

logger:

custom_component:
  - lambda: |-
      auto bno = new esphome::bno055::BNO055Sensor();
      App.register_component(bno);
